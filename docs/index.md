# Documentation repo

This repo has the explicit purpose of being strictly for documentation for outputs for the Muse-IT project. A number of projects, and their details are covered within.

## Setup & structure

This repo is build using a small Python tool called [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/). Their website will help you setup the tool on your machine. In order to run this locally, do the following:

- Clone the repo
- `mkdocs serve` from the top level folder
- Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

You should be presented with a static site. If this fails for some strange reason, no alarm; you can also find the info in markdown on Github, or on your local machine now.

Each project has it's own subfolder. For simplicity, all information is provided within one repo.

Each subfolder has a number of items:

- An index to group information
- An option to search
